                <h3>IMVU</h3>
                <p>After graduating in 2001, Ries went to work to a 3D virtual world called There.com. After the company's failure, Eric left and join one of the founders, Will Harvey, and started IMVU. Later, investor Steve Blank insited Ries to audit Blank's entrepeneurship class at UC Berkeley. Eric picked up important concepts he later implemented on IMVU.</p>

                <h3>The Lean Startup</h3>
                <p>All the key takeaways Eric took from his experience at IMVU, are written in The Lean Startup. Eric offer advice on how to allign the vision, test it fast, get thins going, pivoting and even establishing a clear way to achieve sustainable returns based on the business model you're on. The book quickly became a movement involving a large number of followers around the world.

                <h3>LTSE</h3>
                <p>In 2015, Ries began organizing The Long-Term Stock Exchange (LTSE), which is building a new U.S. stock exchange that aims to align the interests of companies and long-term investors. I specially like the concept of LTSE because I think day-trading has surpassed investor insight as the base on which value is created. Speculation is on it's way to harm the global economy in a serious way.</p>
